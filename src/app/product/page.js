          </h3>
          <p>
            At Beyond, we specialize in recycling solar PV panels using
            cutting-edge technology to ensure minimal environmental impact and
            maximum resource recovery. Our advanced processes safely dismantle
            and reclaim valuable materials, including high-purity silicon, glass
            cullets, aluminium, copper wire, and silver, ready for reuse in new
            solar panel production and other applications. By reintegrating
            these materials into the supply chain, beyond drives the development
            of a circular economy in the solar industry. Our methods
            significantly reduce waste and resource consumption, while lowering
            CO2 emissions, fostering both environmental and economic
            sustainability.
